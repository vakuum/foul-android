Foul is a team building app for Android.

You are a scrum master and your team ignores all the rules? Then this app will save your day. It will keep your sprints clean, your backlog small, your dailies short and your team focused. With the help of a magical whistle and some colored cards, this app will bring your tasks back on track. And in the end, it will improve the overall performance of your team.
